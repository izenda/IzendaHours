# IzendaHours
ASP.NET MVC5 version of my long-running attempt at the Nancy/Angular timeApp

## New ReactJS front-end
I have decided to completely re-write the application, using a NancyFx API and a React SPA.  This application's repository will likely stay under the Izenda account, rather than my own.
